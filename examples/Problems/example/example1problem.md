# Subtracted version from a problem that is key

This problem aims to study the peculiar physics of galaxies, such as their dynamics and structure. In particular,we explain how to measure the mass distribution of our galaxy from the inside. For this we will focus on hydrogen, its main constituent.

Throughout this problem we will only use $\hbar$, defined as $\hbar=h/2\pi$

## Part A. Wolfram alpha trial.

Use wolfram alpha to solve for the integral:
$$
\int_{-10}^{10} e^{-x^2}dx
$$

## Part B - Introduction.
