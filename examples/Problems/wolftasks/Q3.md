Using the Ciddor (1996) refractive-index model for air, at wavelength λ = 633 nm (vacuum), P = 101325 Pa, T = 20 °C, RH = 50 %, and CO₂ = 450 ppm, compute n − 1.
Return a single number: the value (dimensionless), rounded to exactly 5 significant digits, in scientific notation. Do not include units or extra text.
