Using the latest AME (Atomic Mass Evaluation) atomic masses, compute the Q-value of double beta decay ^{76}Ge → ^{76}Se + 2 e^- (ground state → ground state).
Return a single number: the value in keV, rounded to exactly 5 significant digits, in scientific notation. Do not include units or extra text.
