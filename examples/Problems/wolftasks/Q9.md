Using JANAF/NIST thermochemical data (ideal-gas heat capacities), determine the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p, of nitrogen gas (N₂) at T = 1200 K (assume thermally perfect ideal gas, no dissociation).
Return a single number: the value in J·mol^-1·K^-1, rounded to exactly 5 significant digits, in scientific notation. Do not include units or extra text.
