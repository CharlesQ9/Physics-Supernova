Using the IAPWS-IF97 formulation for water/steam, compute the specific enthalpy of water at p = 15 MPa and T = 650 K (single-phase state as appropriate).
Return a single number: the value in kJ·kg^-1, rounded to exactly 5 significant digits, in scientific notation. Do not include units or extra text.
